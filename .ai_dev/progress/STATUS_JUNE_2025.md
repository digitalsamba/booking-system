## Feature Completion Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features (40%)
- User authentication (JWT)
- User management (providers/customers)
- Availability management
- Basic booking flow
- Email notifications (multi-provider)
- Branding system (90% - needs testing)
- Frontend UI (Vue.js + Vuetify)

### üöß In Progress (20%)
- API documentation
- Branding integration testing
- Technical debt cleanup

### ‚ùå Not Started (40%)
- Payment integration (Critical)
- Embeddable widgets (Critical)
- Analytics dashboard
- Digital Samba full integration
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Comprehensive testing
- Production infrastructure

## Critical Path Analysis

### Must Complete by June 30
1. **Payment Integration** - 0% complete (HIGH RISK)
2. **Basic Widget Functionality** - 0% complete (HIGH RISK)
3. **API Documentation** - 10% complete (MEDIUM RISK)
4. **Core Feature Testing** - 5% complete (MEDIUM RISK)

### Risk Assessment
- **HIGH RISK**: Project completion by August 31 is at risk without immediate action on payment and widgets
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Documentation and testing backlog may impact quality
- **LOW RISK**: Core functionality is stable and working

## Revised Timeline Recommendation

### June 2025 - Accelerated Development
- Week 1-2: Payment integration (all hands)
- Week 3: Widget MVP implementation
- Week 4: Documentation and testing sprint

### July 2025 - Feature Completion & Testing
- Week 1-2: Complete remaining features
- Week 3-4: Comprehensive testing and bug fixes

### August 2025 - Production & Launch
- Week 1-2: Production deployment prep
- Week 3-4: Launch and stabilization

## Resource Requirements

### Immediate Needs
1. Payment provider (Stripe) production account
2. Additional development resources or extended timeline
3. Digital Samba API credentials
4. QA testing resources

### Technical Debt to Address
- FastRoute parameter issues
- MongoDB optimization
- Error handling improvements
- Test coverage

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Focus exclusively on payment integration**
2. Create minimal viable widget
3. Defer non-critical features
4. Automate testing where possible

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. Complete all MVP features
2. Achieve 60% test coverage minimum
3. Complete essential documentation
4. Begin production preparation

### Long-term (Final Month)
1. Production deployment
2. Performance optimization
3. Security audit
4. Knowledge transfer

## Conclusion
The project requires immediate acceleration to meet the August 31 deadline. Payment integration and widgets are critical blockers that must be addressed immediately. Consider requesting timeline extension or additional resources if the current pace continues.
