## ðŸ’¡ Efficiency Boosters

### Parallel Implementation
```
In this session, implement [FEATURE] completely:
1. Backend: Model, Service, Controller, Routes
2. Frontend: Store, Components, Views
3. Tests: Unit and Integration
4. Docs: API and User Guide
Don't separate - do all in parallel.
```

### Pattern Matching
```
Implement [NEW FEATURE] following these patterns:
- Service: Like EmailService.php
- Controller: Like BookingController.php
- Model: Like BookingModel.php
- Frontend: Like bookings.js store
- Tests: Like email_service_test.php
Maintain consistency with existing code.
```

### Test-Driven
```
For [FEATURE], write tests first:
1. Define test cases
2. Implement feature to pass tests
3. Add edge cases
4. Ensure 90% coverage
Generate tests alongside implementation.
```
