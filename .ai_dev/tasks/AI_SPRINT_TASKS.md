## AI Session Prompts

### Payment Integration Session
```
Implement complete Stripe payment integration:
- Reference: booking-system-backend/src/Services/EmailService.php for service pattern
- Use existing MongoDB patterns from Models/
- Follow controller structure from BookingController.php
- Match frontend patterns from booking-system-frontend/src/stores/bookings.js

Requirements:
1. Process payments for bookings
2. Handle webhooks for payment status
3. Generate invoices
4. Support refunds

Deliverables this session:
- Backend: Model, Service, Controller, Routes
- Frontend: Store, Components, Payment view
- Tests: Like email_service_test.php pattern
```

### Widget Session
```
Create embeddable booking widget:
- Reference: Public booking view for UI
- Security: Implement CORS properly
- Pattern: Generate code like embed scripts (think Google Analytics)

Requirements:
1. Single JS file that can be embedded
2. Customizable via data attributes
3. Secure cross-domain communication
4. Responsive design

Deliverables:
- Widget architecture + security
- Builder UI in admin panel
- Generated embed code
- Test harness
```

## Efficiency Tips for AI Sessions

### 1. Batch Related Work
Don't do backend then frontend. Do the entire feature:
```
"Implement complete payment feature end-to-end:
backend + frontend + tests in this session"
```

### 2. Reference Existing Patterns
Always point to similar code:
```
"Follow the pattern used in EmailService for PaymentService"
```

### 3. Generate Tests Immediately
```
"For each method, create a test following the email_service_test.php pattern"
```

### 4. Avoid Context Switching
Complete one feature fully before moving to next.
