# SambaConnect Booking System - Project Status

## Overview
The SambaConnect booking system is currently in active development. Core functionality for user management, availability settings, and basic booking operations is implemented and functional. The frontend application built with Vue.js/Pinia and backend API with PHP/MongoDB are communicating properly.

## Completed Features

### User Management
- ✅ User registration and authentication
- ✅ JWT token-based authentication system
- ✅ User profile management
- ✅ Digital Samba integration placeholders

### Availability Management
- ✅ Generate time slots with customizable parameters
- ✅ Bulk slot generation with date range selection
- ✅ Daily time slot configuration
- ✅ Flexible slot duration options (15, 30, 45, 60 minutes)
- ✅ Day of week selection
- ✅ Individual and bulk slot deletion with confirmation dialogs

### Booking Management
- ✅ Create, view, and cancel bookings
- ✅ Public booking interface for external clients
- ✅ Email notification system (initial implementation)
- ✅ Meeting link generation 

### UI/UX
- ✅ Responsive design implementation
- ✅ Vuetify integration for UI components
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ✅ Success notifications/modals
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Light/dark theme support structure

## In Progress Features

### Branding & Customization
- ✅ Designed MongoDB schema for `branding_settings` collection.
- ✅ Created initial backend `BrandingService` and `BrandingController`.
- ✅ Added `GET /api/branding` and `PUT /api/branding` endpoints to `router.php`.
- 🔄 TODO: Implement logo upload functionality (backend).
- 🔄 TODO: Implement frontend UI for managing branding settings.
- 🔄 Research on image handling and storage solutions

### Payment Integration
- 🔄 Initial planning for payment service integration
- 🔄 Fee structure design

### Widget Generation
- 🔄 Early prototype for embeddable booking widgets

## Pending Features

### Payment Processing
- ⏱️ Payment method configuration
- ⏱️ Payment gateway integration
- ⏱️ Invoice generation

### Advanced Embedding Options
- ⏱️ Website widget code generator
- ⏱️ WordPress plugin development
- ⏱️ Custom styling options for embedded widgets

### Reporting & Analytics
- ⏱️ Booking statistics
- ⏱️ Revenue tracking
- ⏱️ Availability utilization reports

## Technical Debt & Issues

### Backend
- ~~'router.php' uses complex/fragile mix of prefix and preg_match routing.~~ (Replaced with FastRoute)
- Controller methods need parameter adjustments for FastRoute parameter passing (Partially done for Booking, DS, Public controllers).
- Instantiate controllers directly (Consider DI container like PHP-DI later).
- Logging relies heavily on `error_log`; consider structured logging (e.g., Monolog).
- Optimize MongoDB queries for better performance.
- Enhance error handling for edge cases.
- Improve security practices for API endpoints.
- ✅ Addressed bug where user profile updates failed silently on frontend due to backend response structure mismatch.

### Frontend
- Refactor some components for better reusability
- Complete unit and integration tests
- Optimize bundle size for production builds
- Address API error handling inconsistencies

## Next Steps

1. Complete the branding customization feature for booking forms
2. Integrate payment processing with Stripe or similar service
3. Develop embeddable widgets for external websites
4. Create comprehensive logging system across all components
5. Implement first version of basic analytics

## Recent Updates
- Refactored backend routing using FastRoute (`nikic/fast-route`) for improved clarity and maintainability.
- Created `config/routes.php` for centralized route definitions.
- Simplified `router.php` to use the FastRoute dispatcher.
- Adjusted several controller methods to accept route parameters from FastRoute.
- Implemented initial backend infrastructure (Service, Controller, Routes) for Branding feature.
- Updated frontend dependencies (Vue to ^3.4, Vite to ^5.3, Axios to ^1.9) to latest stable versions to leverage new features and address security vulnerabilities.
  - *Note: A persistent but low-priority Vite deprecation warning ('CJS build of Vite's Node API is deprecated') remains after updates; dev server functionality is unaffected.*
- Added confirmation dialogs for availability slot deletion
- Improved error handling in API service
- Enhanced profile page with Digital Samba integration
- Added public booking interface with date/time picker
- Updated UI components to follow consistent branding
